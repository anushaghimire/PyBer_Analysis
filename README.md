# Overview

## The purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a new data frame of ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, suburban, and Urban) and using it to how the data differs by city type and use those diffrences in decision making at PyBer. Then using the new data frame I will create a multiple - line graph which will show the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

#### **Looking at the table below the results are:**
- The rural cities have the lowest number of total rides, total drivers and total fares.
- The urban cities have the highest number of total rides, total drivers and total fares.
- The rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per driver.
- The urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver.
- The suburban cities are in the middle of both city types.

#### **Total fare by city types between January and April in 2019**
The image below supports the results from the data above. Furthermore, We can see that all city type have the similar peak times.

## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Recommendations:
1. Since the drivers are less than the total rides in Rural and Suburban areas hiring more drivers would be a good initiative to lower the price per fare.
2. Increase the rides in Urban cities since there are more drivers than total rides.
3. The total fare per driver is low in urban area, maybe increasing a price a little bit more will increase in the fare revenue.
